# Travelling Salesman Problem

1. Upload a python script named UPPERCASEUBUSERID_TSP.py (using your UB User ID in ALL CAPS).
2. Your file should accept 1 command line input argument (the name of a file, minus the extension).  For example, to run the code on a test file named file1.csv, I would call my code with the command:
  ```
  python Script_TSP.py locationfile
  ```
